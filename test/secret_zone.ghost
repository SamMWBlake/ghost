> go secret zone -> secret room

A room command of the form `> go zone -> room` indicates a new *zone context*.
Rooms following the declaration of a new zone context are considered part of
that zone.

Zones exist to allow for granularity of room names. If, for example, you want
players to be able to leave buildings via the command `> go outside`, but you
want the "outside" to consist of more than a single room, you can implement it
as a zone. Zones can contain any number of rooms, and access to and from a zone
can be restricted to specific rooms.

A room command with exit `-> zone -> room` thus indicates that the command `> go
zone` would bring the player to the specified zone and room.
